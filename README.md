RFM Analysis is a concept used by Data Science professionals, especially in the marketing domain for understanding and segmenting customers based on their buying behaviour.

Using RFM Analysis, a business can assess customers’:

- 📅 Recency (the date they made their last purchase)
- 🔄 Frequency (how often they make purchases)
- 💰 Monetary value (the amount spent on purchases)

Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value of a customer are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.

To perform RFM analysis using Python, we need a dataset that includes customer IDs, purchase dates, and transaction amounts. With this information, we can calculate RFM values for each customer and analyze their patterns and behaviours.
